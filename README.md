# Assignment 6 - Randomized Snake

## Running the code

Follow instructions on r/ludobots to install python, pybullet and pyrosim, create a repository and change your directory accordingly.

## Goal

Our goal is to generate a kinematic chain (a jointed, motorized, innervated, sensorized snake) with a random number of randomly shaped links with random sensor placement along the chain.

Links with and without sensors should be colored green and blue, respectively.
